# Meme Bank

My Meme template collection. As a r/linuxmemes member I saw several memes about
opensource memes yet couldn't find any repos containing meme templates. So I
created a one. Here it is. You can use it and also add more memes with a PR.
Memes here are commonly used ones so I assume they are in public domain. If I'm
wrong, let me know, deleting a file isn't that hard :-). 

If you clone this repo, make sure to run `chmod -w "*.jpg"` to prevent
accidentally editing the original meme template.
